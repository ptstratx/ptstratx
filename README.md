<img src="https://github.com/ptstratx/ptstratx/blob/master/images/logo_ptstratx.png" align="right" height="160" width="200">

Profit Trailer 2 introduces trading with multiple indicators and indicator settings for Buy, DCA and Sell orders.

**For the first time it is possible to test and view up to 5 indicators in different time periods (1 min - 1 week) in one chart simultaneously!**

Even experienced traders and chart analysts are facing difficulties now and struggle to create suitable strategies.

Our script allows to find this "best" strategy with ease, to visually verify it as your strategy and finally run backtests with historical data.

You immediately see if the strategy is good for profitable trades and then can test it by using the strategy tester in TradigView to find out how lucrative it would have been.

Many ProfitTrailer users trust us already and move extremely successful on the market. Currently, the best Bottraders work exclusively with PTStratX to create their strategies for the ProfitTrailer 2.

## Features

The buy strategy can consist of up to 5 different combinations, which you can compose out of 11 indicators:

* EMACROSS
* EMASPREAD
* EMAGAIN
* SMACROSS
* SMASPREAD
* SMAGAIN
* HIGHBB
* LOWBB
* MACD
* RSI
* STOCHRSI

The DCA strategy can consist of up to 2 different combinations, which you can put together from 12 indicators. (Please note: Anderson DCA must always be one of the 2 possible DCA strategies in the current version.):

* EMACROSS
* EMASPREAD
* EMAGAIN
* SMACROSS
* SMASPREAD
* SMAGAIN
* HIGHBB
* LOWBB
* MACD
* RSI
* STOCHRSI
* ANDERSON

The sell strategy can consist of up to 3 different combinations, which you can create out of 11 indicators. Gain is always set as sell strategy A.

* GAIN
* EMACROSS
* EMASPREAD
* EMAGAIN
* SMACROSS
* SMASPREAD
* SMAGAIN
* HIGHBB
* MACD
* RSI
* STOCHRSI

Furthermore, the price trailing as well as the stop loss as used by PT2 can be activated.

All indicators are individually adjustable by their parameters and also decoupled in time resolution from the time period used in the main Tradingview Chart. E.g. this allows you to use the LOWBB 1H, RSI 15 min and MACD 1 day with 1 min prices in Tradingview.

**There is no other script available out there which can deliver you these features by far.**

Another highlight is the possibility to display when the individual purchase strategies are fulfilled. With that you are able to easily recognize where adjustments are necessary so that the order entry is made at your desired entry point.

Please note: For best results, please set the candle period of the chart itself to 1, 3 or 5 min as this allows the best behavior for trailing, buy, DCA and sell and be as close to the results of profit trailer as possible.
